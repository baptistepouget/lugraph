# lugraph
Library for function graphs generation in lua

# How to use 
Create one or many lua functions that take one argument and return the result

Like that

`
foo = function (x)
	return x+1
end
`

Then use the lugraph.draw function provided by the library

` lugraph.draw(filename,left,right,up,down,scaleX,scaleY, ... ) `

filename is the name of the ppm (image) file
left is the space in pixels at the left of the y axis
right is the space in pixels at the right of the y axis
up is the space in pixels above the x axis
down is the space in pixels at under the x axis

scaleX is the scale on the x axis (1 for no scale)
scaleY is the scale on the y axis (1 for no scale)

the following arguments are the functions you want to pass
